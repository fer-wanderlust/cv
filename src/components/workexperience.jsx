                        <p>I am part of the Clinical Medical History and Hospital Management System's Development used in hospitals and community rooms of the Government of Buenos Aires city.
                        The system development is build on a modern web architecture (Angular JS, Django, Django REST Framework). The system is used on a daily basis for 2-3 thousand of users (Professional in Medicine and Administrators) and has a database of more than half million patients.
                        The tasks that I develop are design, implement and build new modules of the system, fix bugs and errors and add new features into the different modules. I participate in the Back-end as well as the Front-end part of the system.</p>

                        I developed several tools that involved doing the UI design, doing the connection with
                        the database (Oracle and Microsoft Access) and doing calculation with data. In order
                        to do these calculations I had to read books and papers and talk with chemists and
                        geologists.</p>
